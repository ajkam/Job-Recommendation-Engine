# Job Recommendation System

This repository contains two Python scripts that work together to recommend job opportunities based on the contents of a resume. The `Job_Data_Preparer.py` script preprocesses job data, while the `Job_Recommendation_Engine.py` script analyzes a resume and recommends relevant job opportunities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries: `streamlit`, `dotenv`, `PyPDF2`, `langchain-text-splitters`, `langchain-community`, `langchain-openai`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `sklearn`, `geopy`

## Installation

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit python-dotenv PyPDF2 langchain-text-splitters langchain-community langchain-openai pandas nltk scikit-learn geopy
```

Before running the scripts, download the necessary NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Job Data:

- Place the job data in an Excel file (e.g., `Job_data.xlsx`).
- Run the `Job_Data_Preparer.py` script:
  - This will generate a new Excel file (e.g., `Job_data_cleaned.xlsx`) containing the preprocessed job data.

### 2. Run the Job Recommendation Engine:

- Launch the Streamlit application by running:
  ```bash
  streamlit run Job_Recommendation_Engine.py
  ```
- Upload your resume PDF(s) and interact with the application to receive job recommendations.

## Note

Make sure to adjust file paths and names in the scripts according to your data files. Also, ensure that the `Job_Recommendation_Engine.py` script is configured to use the output file generated by the `Job_Data_Preparer.py` script.

```bash
python Job_Data_Preparer.py
```
